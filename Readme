# Line Intersection API

The Line Intersection API is a RESTful API that allows you to find intersections between a given line and a set of lines. It leverages the Turf.js library for geospatial calculations.

## How to Use

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Starting the Server

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`

### Authentication

- The API uses token-based authentication for accessing protected endpoints.
- Include the `Authorization` header in your requests with a valid token.
- Please contact the server administrator to obtain a valid token for authentication.

### Finding Line Intersections

- Endpoint: `POST /intersections`
- Request Body: JSON object with a `lineString` property representing the line to find intersections for.
  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "lineString": {
      "type": "LineString",
      "coordinates": [
        [-74.0386542, 40.7302174],
        [-74.038756, 40.7295611]
      ]
    }
  }

Testing with Postman or cURL
Open Postman or a terminal for cURL requests.
Set the request method to POST.
Set the request URL to http://localhost:3000/intersections.
Set the Authorization header with a valid token.
Set the request body as described above.
Send the request and check the response for line intersections.
Please note that you need to replace your/repository.git with the actual repository URL where the code is hosted. Also, make sure to provide the valid token for authentication.
